# Data monitoring with MQTT, InfluxDB and Grafana

IoT data monitoring with MQTT, InfluxDB and Grafana

This repository contains a
[docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and
[Arduino MKR NB 1500](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr-nb-1500)
based project for monitoring some real world sensor over an NB-IoT network.

The work is based on [Gautier Mechling](https://github.com/Nilhcem)'s
[home-monitoring-grafana](https://github.com/Nilhcem/home-monitoring-grafana),
described in his [blog post]
(http://nilhcem.com/iot/home-monitoring-with-mqtt-influxdb-grafana).

The present repository has been adapted for the [https://iothon.io](IoThon 2019) hackathon,
and is considerably different from the original one.

The default instructions below explain how to install and test the presented
approach using two computers:

1. A *laptop* (or similar) used to program the Arduino MKR NB 1500
2. A *server* (or similar) running an MQTT server, InfluxDB database,
   and Grafana data visualisation.

Of course, you don't need to have a laptop, but may instead have a
Raspberry Pi or similar machine, used to program the Arduino.  However,
we call that machine as a _laptop_ in these instructions.
If you want to, you can also run everything on a single machine.

*NOTE* that your *server* must have a public IP address for being able
to receive MQTT data from your Arduino.  You should have this IP address
handly, since you will know it below.

## A security note

*NOTE* that these instructions do not explain how to secure your
MQTT or other communication with your server, e.g., with TLS.  If you
want to use TLS, see e.g. this
[Dev Side Story](https://devsidestory.com/lets-encrypt-with-docker/)
for running a TLS front end on your server side.
For your Arduino, you may want to adapt from the instructions for securely
[connecting to Azure](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Arduino_Genuino/securely-connecting-an-arduino-nb-1500-to-azure-iot-hub-af6470).

## Subfolders

The first three subfolders are prepared for your *server*:
- `00-docker`: Docker compose configuration for MQTT, InfluxDB and Grafana
- `01-mosquitto`: Docker container configuration files for Eclipse [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org)
- `02-bridge`: Python script that receives MQTT data and stores them to InfluxDB

The final subfolder is meant to be used in your *laptop*:
- `03-arduino_mqtt`: Arduino sketch file for the MKR NB 1500 that publishes sensor data to MQTT

## Setup

### Clone this repository to *both* your laptop and your server

For cloning this repository, you need
[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).  Most probably your Linux or
Mac OS X has it already.  For Windows, or if your computer doesn't
have git, you can follow the
[official instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
If you haven't worked with git before, you may want to install
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) instead.

Once you have `git` installed, clone this repository to a suitable
folder in *both* of your *laptop* and *server*.  On the command line, simply give the command

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/iothon/docker-compose-mqtt-influxdb-grafana.git
   cd docker-compose-mqtt-influxdb-grafana
```
Alternatively, use your GitHub Desktop or equivalent.

### Install docker and docker compose to your *server*

Install
[docker](https://docs.docker.com) and
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), if you don't have
them yet in your *server*.
If you don't know if you have them installed, simply try to run the
commands `docker` and `docker-compose` on the command line.

For Windows or Mac OS X, the easiest way is to install
[Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
Alternatively, for Mac OS X you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh),
with `brew install docker docker-compose`.

For Linux (Ubuntu or other Debian based), just use `apt install`:

```sh
   sudo apt install docker.io
   sudo apt install docker-compose
```

For anything else, follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

### Manage docker as a non-root user

In Linux, if you don't want to use `sudo` in the front of every `docker` or
`docker-compose` command below, you need to add a `docker` group and assign
yourself to it.  You can follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).

For the IoThon Ubuntu VM, do the following:
```sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker iothon
```

Log out from your SSH session (or terminal) and log in again (or open new terminal).

### Running Mosquitto + InfluxDB + Grafana in docker, in your *server*

Set the `DATA_DIR` environment variable to the path where will be stored local data, e.g. `/tmp`
if you are just testing.  For your IoThon demonstration or other "production", choose
something else.

```sh
   export DATA_DIR=/tmp
```

Create data directories, with write access for the Mosquitto and Grafana containers:

```sh
   mkdir -p ${DATA_DIR}/mosquitto/data ${DATA_DIR}/mosquitto/log ${DATA_DIR}/influxdb ${DATA_DIR}/grafana
   sudo chown -R 1883:1883 ${DATA_DIR}/mosquitto
   sudo chown -R 472:472 ${DATA_DIR}/grafana
```

Run docker compose:

```sh
   cd 00-docker
   docker-compose up -d
```

This starts four containers on your *server*: Mosquitto, InfluxDB, Grafana, and
the Mosquitto-to-InfluxDB bridge from the `02-bridge` folder.  You can check that
they are nicely up and running with

```sh
   docker ps
```

You should see all the four containers running continuously, and not restarting.
If any of them is restarting, you can use `docker logs `_container_ to see its
logs, or `docker exec -it _container_ sh` to run a shell in the container.

To shut down your containers, e.g. if you need to change the settings, run
```sh
   docker-compose down
```

You can now test your Granafa at http://<your-host-ip>:3000.  See below how to
log in to and configure Grafana, and how to get the data flowing.

The Mosquitto username and passwords are `mqttuser` and `mqttpassword`.
To change these, see the `Optional: Update mosquitto credentials` section below.

## Grafana setup

It is a good idea to log in your Grafana right away and change your
`admin` password.  You can also add an InfluxDB data source already now,
or later.  For having a meaningful Dashboard, you must first get some
data to your InfluxDB database.

- Access Grafana from `http://<host ip>:3000`
- Log in with user/password `admin/admin`
- Go to Configuration > Data Sources
- Add data source (InfluxDB)
  - Name: `InfluxDB`
  - URL: `http://influxdb:8086`
  - Database: `home_db`
  - User: `root`
  - Password: `root`
  - Save & Test
- Create a Dashboard
  - Add Graph Panel
  - Edit Panel
  - Data Source: InfluxDB
  - FROM: `[default] [temperature] WHERE [location]=[bme280]`
  - SELECT: `field(value)`
  - FORMAT AS: `Time series`
  - Draw mode: Lines
  - Stacking & Null value: Null value [connected]
  - Left Y
    - Unit: Temperature > Celcius
  - Panel title: Temperature (Â°C)

## Programming the sensor(s) with your *laptop*

For programming your sensors, the easiest way is to use the
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).  If you
are more experienced, you can also [use GCC and a flasher directly](TBD).

Sensors should send data to the mosquitto broker to the following MQTT topic:
`home/{peripheralName}/{sensorname}`.
For example: `home/mkrnb1500/temperature`.

Arduino sketches for the MKR NB 1500 are provided to in `03-arduino_mqtt`.
Before flashing, you need to change the `MQTT_SERVER` constant to MQTT *server* IP address.

For using any interesting sensors, you will need to modify the sketch to
use a suitable sensor driver to fetch the data from the sensor and to pass
it via MQTT to your server.


## Optional: Update mosquitto credentials

To change default MQTT username and password, run the following, replacing `[USER]` and `[PASSWORD]`:

```sh
   cd 01-mosquitto
   echo -n "" > users
   docker run --rm -v `pwd`/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf \
                   -v `pwd`/users:/mosquitto/config/users eclipse-mosquitto:1.5 \
              mosquitto_passwd -b /mosquitto/config/users [USER] [PASSWORD]
   cd ..
```

Then, update the `MQTT_USER` and `MQTT_PASSWORD` constants in all the subdirectories, and launch docker compose again.
